# PUI2017_dcr346

**How did I set up my environment:**

1. Followed the Assignment2 instructions and created on CUSP compute a directory called PUI2017. 

2. Using "export" I created the variable that points to PUI2017 directory and "alias" to create the alias "pui2017". 

The first screenshot is me checking my alias at bash:
  
![Alt text](screenshots/screenshot1_bash.png)

The second screenshot is of the vi where I set the 'export' and 'alias' commands:
 
![Alt text](screenshots/screenshot2_vi.png)

3. I got out of CUSP compute and cloned the PUI2017 directory to my local machine, moved (through terminal)  the screenshots which were by then on my home desktop to a new sub-folder "screenshots".

4. Opened "README" in atom and put the screenshots in it; then opened the README at emacs to describe my workflow. 

5. Will git add, git commit -m "updated README", git push origin master (hope that will work out well :))
